### From Science Fiction to Reality:

The concept of controlling machines directly with your brain once belonged to the realm of science fiction. But today, **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)** are transforming how we interact with technology. BCIs bridge the gap between neurological activity and digital systems, enabling direct communication between the brain and external devices.

Now, you might think this technology requires expensive equipment and lab access, but you can build your own BCI at home! In this blog, we’ll walk you through building a custom BCI using the **OpenBCI UltraCortex**  headset frame, a **PiEEG** board, **Conscious Labs ThinkPulse Electrodes**, and a **Raspberry Pi**.

**What You'll Need:**

* **3D printer**

## Getting Started: Capturing Brainwave Data in Real-Time
Before setting out to build a BCI, it is crucial to understand our brainwave acquisition strategy. Our build will need to be non-invasive and functional within a range of environments. It will need to record a users brain signals in real time and translate the signal into something that a computer can read. To accomplish this, our BCI will leverage a technology called **Electroencephalography (EEG)**.  

<br>  

> **Tip:** **Electroencephalography (EEG)** was invented by Hans Berger in 1924 and has been used in clinical and research settings ever since. Berger was the first to record brainwaves, coining the term "electroencephalogram" to describe the electrical activity he observed in the human brain. His pioneering work laid the foundation for modern neuroscience and the development of brain-computer interfaces.


### What is EEG and Why is it the Most Common Tool in Modern BCIs?

**Electroencephalography (EEG)** is a method of recording electrical activity generated by neurons in the brain. It’s the most widely used tool in BCIs because it provides a non-invasive way to monitor brain function. EEG signals are captured through electrodes placed on the scalp, which detect the voltage fluctuations that result from neuronal firing. What makes EEG so useful for BCIs is the ability to record brain activity in real time, providing immediate feedback on the brain's state.

<br>

<br>

EEG is commonly used in clinical and research settings, particularly in neurology and cognitive science, to study brain disorders such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and stroke recovery. For BCIs, EEG is favored because it allows direct monitoring of brain activity without surgery, making it accessible to a broad range of users. Though EEG’s spatial resolution (its ability to pinpoint where in the brain signals are coming from) is limited, its temporal resolution (its ability to track when signals occur) is excellent. This is crucial for BCIs that require immediate brainwave data for interaction with external devices.

<br>

### The Science of Brainwaves: Alpha, Beta, Gamma Waves Explained

EEG captures a variety of brainwave frequencies, each associated with different mental states or cognitive processes. These brainwaves are typically classified into five frequency bands, each of which reflects different aspects of brain activity:

* **Delta Waves** *(0.5 – 4 Hz)*: Associated with deep sleep and restorative processes, delta waves are slow brainwaves observed when the body is in a state of rest.
* **Theta Waves** *(4 – 8 Hz):* Commonly linked to creativity, relaxation, and meditative states. Theta waves are often seen during light sleep or deep meditation.
* **Alpha Waves** *(8 – 13 Hz)*: These brainwaves indicate a calm and relaxed state, typically when the eyes are closed and the mind is at ease. Alpha waves are dominant when the brain is idle or in a resting state but still alert.
* **Beta Waves** *(13 – 30 Hz)*: High-frequency beta waves are seen when the brain is engaged in active thinking, problem-solving, or concentration. They are linked to alertness and cognitive tasks.
* **Gamma Waves** *(30 – 100 Hz)*: The fastest of the brainwave frequencies, gamma waves are associated with high-level information processing, such as during learning or when integrating multiple sensory inputs.

For our BCI build, we will focus primarily on alpha, beta, and gamma waves due to their relevance in cognitive tasks and relaxation states. These brainwaves are particularly useful when working on applications that involve focus, cognitive load management, or neurofeedback systems.

> **Pro Tip:** While EEG provides excellent temporal resolution (timing of brain activity), keep in mind its spatial resolution (where activity happens in the brain) is limited. This is why correct **electrode placement** is critical!

### Choosing the Right Build Components:
The *right* build components will always be a bit subjective. For EEG signal acquisition and processing, our BCI will need to contain a series of electrodes and a central processor to read brainwaves. The electrodes will need to be held in place securely on a users physical body. **This guide has been built around the following components:**  

<br>

#### The UltraCortex Frame:

![Untracortex](/img/img_0275.jpg)

<br>

The [OpenBCI UltraCortex](https://github.com/openbci-archive/Docs/tree/master/assets/MarkIV/STL_Directory) headset frame is modular and 3D-printable, allowing us to easily modify or replace parts as needed. Its open-source design ensures that we can customize it to our specific application—whether we’re focusing on research or personal experimentation.

<br>

#### ThinkPulse Electrodes:

![Untracortex](/img/img_0472.jpg)

<br>

[Conscious Labs ThinkPulse Electrodes](https://shop.openbci.com/products/thinkpulse-active-electrode-kit?variant=37113738985630) are  **Active**, **Dry**, electrodes, which means they are powered and don’t require conductive gel. These electrodes provide reliable signal quality without the mess.

> **Note:** Dry electrodes can be slightly more prone to noise compared to wet electrodes. Make sure the scalp has proper contact for accurate readings.

<br>

#### PiEEG:

![Untracortex](/img/pieeg-16_3.jpg)

<br>

[PiEEG](https://pieeg.com/) is specifically designed for EEG data acquisition and interfaces directly with a Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins. This allows the Raspberry Pi to read the low-voltage signals from the EEG electrodes and process them in real-time.

> **Note:** An OpenBCI Cyton board can be used instead of a PiEEG. Please visit the [OpenBCI Store](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/cyton-biosensing-board-8-channel) for details.

### Build Walkthrough: 3D Printing & Assembly

The first step in our BCI build is to print the **UltraCortex** frame and necessary parts. Using a 3D printer like the **AnyCubic Kobra**, we can produce custom parts for the UltraCortex, allowing complete control over the fit and design of the headset. If you do not have a 3D printer, or would rather not print the frame, you can purchase a completed print from the OpenBCI store.

![Untracortex](/img/img_0159.jpg)

<br>

#### 1. Material Selection:

For this build, we used **ANYCUBIC PLA filament 1.75mm**, which is strong yet lightweight—ideal for wearable devices like BCIs. PLA is also beginner-friendly for 3D printing, but other materials like PETG can be considered for more strength.

> **Tip:** When selecting filament, ensure it has a good balance between strength and flexibility, especially for wearable tech.

<br>

#### 2. Printing the Frame:

Head over to the [OpenBCI GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBCI/Ultracortex/tree/master/Mark_IV/MarkIV-FINAL/STL_Directory) and download the **Front** and **Back** .STL files. Make sure you choose either *small*, *medium*, or *large*, depending on your desired fit. 

> **Head circumference:** small = 42-50cm, medium = 48-58cm, large = 58-65cm

<br>

The **UltraCortex** can also be printed in one stage, instead of two, if your printer can support the size and complexity of the print.

Print settings will vary widely from printer to printer. The absolute minimum build area needed to print the frame in halves is *130 mm by 210 mm square*. This print does require support. Because of the detail in the UltraCortex model, a slower print speed (50%) is suggested.
<br>

<br>

![Untracortex](/img/img_0189.jpg)

<br>

![Untracortex](/img/img_0272.jpg)

<br>

> **Note:** Depending on your 3D printer, it can take 48 hours or more to print the UltraCortex. While you wait, move on to step 4 and prepare your assembly strategy. 

<br>

#### 3. Printing the Electrode Screw & Screw Mounts:

With the front and back of the **UltraCortex** frame printed, download and print the [Electrode Screws](https://github.com/OpenBCI/Ultracortex/blob/master/Mark_IV/M4_Hardware_09_Octabolt.STL) and [Screw Mounts](https://github.com/OpenBCI/Ultracortex/blob/master/Mark_IV/M4_Hardware_09_Eholder.STL), which are used to secure the ThinkPulse electrodes to the frame (OpenBCI referrs to these as the **Octabolt** and **Eholder**). These small parts need precise printing to function well and are crucial to maintain proper contact with the scalp.

> **Note:** Depending on your 3D printer, finished prints may have a lot of support that needs to be removed. Carefully remove support and sand the finished prints with a fine grit sandpaper while waiting for the next print to finish.  

<br>

#### 4. Custom Jumpers & Electrode Power Distribution:

Modularity was a key factor in choosing the UltraCortex frame as an initial platform for our BCI, so we want to ensure we maintain modularity in our design approach. To simplify the effort of connecting electrodes to our PiEEG, while also maintaining modular design, **custom color-coded jumpers** can be created to extend the PiEEG board pins out of its enclosure. 

We made it easy to remember by color-coding each jumper wire to a specific electrode, allowing us to easily troubleshoot and identify connections. When we start writing code to visualize the brainwave signals, we will use the same color scheme. 

<br>

![Untracortex](/img/img_0559.jpg)

<br>

A **Power Distribution Board** is used to distribute power from the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins (GPIO 1 (+) and 5 (-)) to each electrode. 

<br>

![Untracortex](/img/img_0590.jpg)

<br>

Custom red and black jumpers were created to easily connect each electrode while the power distribution board is hidden cleanly out of sight. 

<br>

#### 5. UltraCortex Assembly & Finish

Once the UltraCortex frame and related parts have printed, make sure to carefully remove all support and sand the surface of the frame with fine grit sandpaper to prepare for painting. 

To assemble the fame match up the front and back - securing them with super glue. Once the glue has dried, insert the **Electrode Screw Mounts** into the frame at the positions where electrode placement is desired - securing again with super glue. 

> **Note:** A final sanding with fine grit sandpaper may be needed after glue has set to ensure a clean finish. 

Choose a quality spray paint that fits your desired aesthetic. Move the frame and electrode screws + mounts to a safe, ventilated, space with a surface that has been prepared for painting. Have fun and be creative.    

When painting, make sure to shake the can well before and during use. Try to continuously move side to side as you paint and avoid drips by painting multiple thin coats - letting them dry in between each coat. 

<br>

![Untracortex](/img/img_0337.jpg)

<br>

> **Note:** The **Electrode Screws** and **Screw Mounts** should receive minimal paint to avoid interfering with their function.

#### 6.Electrode Assembly & Custom Sleeves:

The Conscious Labs ThinkPulse Electrodes are inserted into the 3D printed **UltraCortex Electrode Screw** with a small spring. The springs are not included with the electrodes but can be easily found at most hardware stores or online. The assembled electrode and screw will be inserted into the UltraCortex frame during final assembly.  

To fit the desired aesthetic of our build, we chose to incorporate some custom cable sleeves to spice up the electrode cables boring grey cable jacket. Spools of cable sleeving can be easily found on Amazon along with heat shrink wrap for the ends.  

> **Note:** The cable sleeving will quickly fray after cutting it. Have a lighter on hand to melt the end of the sleeve after cutting keep the sleeve intact while you assemble.  

<br>

#### 7. PiEEG Installation:

![Untracortex](/img/img_0305.jpg)

The PiEEG connects directly to the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins and is used to convert brain signals into usable data. Carefully align the PiEEG on the Raspberry Pi, ensuring each pin is securely connected. This is crucial for smooth communication between the electrodes and the processor.

The Raspberry Pi can be powered via USB-C. To reduce noise in the EEG signal, and to add mobility to the BCI, a battery should be used. 

> **Tip:** The PiSugar2 Pro is a compact solution that conveniently attaches to the bottom of the Raspberry Pi. 

Once assembled, install the Raspberry Pi and PiEEG into a Pi case that is tall enough to support a hat. The case can be attached onto the UltraCortex frame using screws installed into the bottom of the case or zip ties.

<br>

#### 8. Electrode installation & Wire Management:

Finish the assembly by screwing the electrode screws into their appropriate mounts and cleanly tie the wires down to the UltraCortex frame.

![Untracortex](/img/img_0493.jpg)

<br>

Connect the electrode signal jumper cable to the electrode pins on the PiEEG. Connect a jumper wire from GPIO pin 1 (+) and GPIO pin (5) to the power distribution boards power inputs and connect the red and black jumper cables to the power distribution boards power outputs. Finally, connect the electrode power wires to their corresponding pins on the red and black jumpers. 

<br>

![Untracortex](/img/img_0595.jpg)

<br>

Carefully position the wires and power distribution board into the Pi case and assemble. Feed the jumper wires out of the case and neatly organize with zip ties. Once assembled, the BCI is complete and ready for testing.
