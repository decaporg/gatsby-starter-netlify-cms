### From Science Fiction to Reality:

The concept of controlling machines directly with your brain once belonged to the realm of science fiction. But today, **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)** are transforming how we interact with technology. BCIs bridge the gap between neurological activity and digital systems, enabling direct communication between the brain and external devices.

Now, you might think this technology requires expensive equipment and lab access, but you can build your own BCI at home! In this blog, we’ll walk you through building a custom BCI using the **OpenBCI UltraCortex headset frame**, **PiEEG**, **Conscious Labs ThinkPulse electrodes**, and a **Raspberry Pi**.

**What You'll Need:**

* 3D printer (or purchase printed from OpenBCI)
* PLA filament
* UltraCortex STA files
* Raspberry Pi (4 or 5)
* PiEEG (8 or 16 channels)
* PiSugar Battery
* Raspberry Pi case (with hat support)

> **Tip:** Ensure you have a steady supply of patience, as building BCIs requires attention to detail and troubleshooting along the way.

### Getting Started: Capturing Brainwave Data in Real-Time

<br>

#### What is EEG and Why is it the Most Common Tool in Modern BCIs?

![Untracortex](/img/experiments_plot.png)

<br>

**Electroencephalography (EEG)** is a method of recording electrical activity generated by neurons in the brain. It’s the most widely used tool in BCIs because it provides a non-invasive way to monitor brain function. EEG signals are captured through electrodes placed on the scalp, which detect the voltage fluctuations that result from neuronal firing. What makes EEG so useful for BCIs is the ability to record brain activity in real time, providing immediate feedback on the brain's state.
EEG is commonly used in clinical and research settings, particularly in neurology and cognitive science, to study brain disorders such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and stroke recovery. For BCIs, EEG is favored because it allows direct monitoring of brain activity without surgery, making it accessible to a broad range of users. Though EEG’s spatial resolution (its ability to pinpoint where in the brain signals are coming from) is limited, its temporal resolution (its ability to track when signals occur) is excellent. This is crucial for BCIs that require immediate brainwave data for interaction with external devices.

##### The Science of Brainwaves: Alpha, Beta, Gamma Waves Explained

EEG captures a variety of brainwave frequencies, each associated with different mental states or cognitive processes. These brainwaves are typically classified into five frequency bands, each of which reflects different aspects of brain activity:

* Delta Waves (0.5 – 4 Hz): Associated with deep sleep and restorative processes, delta waves are slow brainwaves observed when the body is in a state of rest.
* Theta Waves (4 – 8 Hz): Commonly linked to creativity, relaxation, and meditative states. Theta waves are often seen during light sleep or deep meditation.
* Alpha Waves (8 – 13 Hz): These brainwaves indicate a calm and relaxed state, typically when the eyes are closed and the mind is at ease. Alpha waves are dominant when the brain is idle or in a resting state but still alert.
* Beta Waves (13 – 30 Hz): High-frequency beta waves are seen when the brain is engaged in active thinking, problem-solving, or concentration. They are linked to alertness and cognitive tasks.
* Gamma Waves (30 – 100 Hz): The fastest of the brainwave frequencies, gamma waves are associated with high-level information processing, such as during learning or when integrating multiple sensory inputs.

For our BCI build, we will focus primarily on alpha, beta, and gamma waves due to their relevance in cognitive tasks and relaxation states. These brainwaves are particularly useful when working on applications that involve focus, cognitive load management, or neurofeedback systems.

> **Pro Tip:** While EEG provides excellent temporal resolution (timing of brain activity), keep in mind its spatial resolution (where activity happens in the brain) is limited. This is why correct **electrode placement** is critical!

#### Choosing the Right Build Components:

<br>

##### The UltraCortex Frame:

![Untracortex](/img/img_0275.jpg)

<br>

The **OpenBCI UltraCortex** headset frame is modular and 3D-printable, allowing us to easily modify or replace parts as needed. Its open-source design ensures that we can customize it to our specific application—whether we’re focusing on research or personal experimentation.

<br>

##### ThinkPulse Electrodes:

![Untracortex](/img/img_0472.jpg)

<br>

**Conscious Labs ThinkPulse** electrodes are dry electrodes, which means they don’t require conductive gel—making setup faster and cleaner. These electrodes provide reliable signal quality, especially important in DIY projects where ease of use and precision are key.

> **Note:** Dry electrodes can be slightly more prone to noise compared to wet electrodes. Make sure the scalp has proper contact for accurate readings.

<br>

##### PiEEG:

![Untracortex](/img/pieeg-16_3.jpg)

<br>

**PiEEG** is specifically designed for EEG data acquisition and interfaces directly with a Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins. This allows the Raspberry Pi to read the low-voltage signals from the EEG electrodes and process them in real-time.

### Build Walkthrough: 3D Printing & Assembly

Using a 3D printer like the **AnyCubic Kobra**, we can produce custom parts for the UltraCortex, allowing complete control over the fit and design of the headset.

![Untracortex](/img/img_0159.jpg)

<br>

#### 1. Material Selection:

For this build, we used **PLA filament**, which is strong yet lightweight—ideal for wearable devices like BCIs. PLA is also beginner-friendly for 3D printing, but other materials like PETG can be considered for more strength.

> **Tip:** When selecting filament, ensure it has a good balance between strength and flexibility, especially for wearable tech.

<br>

#### 2. Printing the Frame:

We printed the front and back of the UltraCortex in separate stages, carefully aligning the pieces to ensure a smooth fit. This took several hours, but patience is key when printing such intricate designs.

#### 3. Printing the Electrode Screw & Screw Mounts:

Next, we printed the screws and electrode mounts, which are essential for securing the ThinkPulse electrodes. These small parts need precise printing to maintain proper contact with the scalp.

#### 4. Custom Cabling:

To ensure the BCI works efficiently, we designed **custom color-coded jumpers**. Each jumper corresponds to a specific electrode, allowing us to easily troubleshoot and identify connections.

#### 5.Electrode Assembly & Custom Sleeves:

The Conscious Labs ThinkPulse Electrodes are inserted into the 3D printed UltraCortex electrode screw with a small spring. The screw will be inserted into the UltraCortex frame during final assembly.  

To fit the desired aesthetic of our build, we chose to incorporate some custom cable sleeves to spice up the electrode cables boring grey cable jacket.

#### 6. PiEEG Installation:

![Untracortex](/img/img_0305.jpg)

The PiEEG Hat connects directly to the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins to convert brain signals into usable data. Carefully align the PiEEG Hat on the Raspberry Pi, ensuring each pin is properly connected. This is crucial for smooth communication between the electrodes and the processor.

The Raspberry Pi can be powered via USB-C. To reduce noise in the EEG signal, and to add mobility to the BCI, a battery should be used. 

> **Tip:** The PiSugar2 Pro is a compact solution that conveniently attaches to the bottom of the Raspberry Pi. 

Once assembled, install the Raspberry Pi and PiEEG into a Pi case that is tall enough to support a hat. The case can be attached onto the UltraCortex frame using screws installed into the bottom of the case or zip ties.
